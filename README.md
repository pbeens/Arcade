# Arcade
 Various programs written in Python using the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/index.html) library.

[Birds](Birds)

This is a simple demonstration of using the arcade library to create and display graphics on a window. The program uses functions, variables, loops, and random numbers to draw 10 birds in different positions on a white background. The program shows how to use the `arcade.draw_arc_outline` function to create shapes with curves, and how to use the `random.randint` function to generate random integers within a range. The program also shows how to define and call a custom function to draw a bird using two arc outlines. The program is an example of how to use the arcade library for basic graphics programming in Python.

[Grid of Circles](Grid-of-Circles)

 This program uses the [Arcade](https://api.arcade.academy/en/latest/index.html) library to create a window with a black background and draw a grid of circles with random colors and sizes. The number of rows and columns, the window size, and the minimum and maximum circle size can be changed by modifying the variables at the beginning of the program. The program runs until the user closes the window.
