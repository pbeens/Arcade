# Arcade
 Various programs written in Python using the Arcade library.

[Grid of Circles](Grid-of-Circles)

 This program uses the Arcade library to create a window with a black background and draw a grid of circles with random colors and sizes. The number of rows and columns, the window size, and the minimum and maximum circle size can be changed by modifying the variables at the beginning of the program. The program runs until the user closes the window.
